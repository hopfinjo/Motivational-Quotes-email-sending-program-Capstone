# 2.6 Run Server Client Structure
## User Acceptance Test 1: Start frontend driver

1. Start program in CMD-Line by running "gui_motivational_quotes.py" in program-production folder. (Ensure MongoDB is running and listening on port 27017)
2. See all other user acceptance tests to see specific functionality of Graphical User Interface.

## User Acceptance Test 2: Run backend/server code.
1. Start program in CMD-Line by running "email_sending_SMTP.py" in program-production folder. (Ensure MongoDB is running and listening on port 27017). Also ensure that at least one user is stored in database/signed up for service before.
2. See system responding with"run me, and I will send emails to all users that are in the db, I check for new users twice a day"
3. The server code is now up and running and sending emails to users on their scheduled time (all users that are in the db).
It will update it's schedule every 12 hours. So allow program 12 hours to respond to possible changes made by frontend code/users.
