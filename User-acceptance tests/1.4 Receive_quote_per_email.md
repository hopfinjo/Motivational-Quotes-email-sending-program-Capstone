# 1.4 As a user I want to receive a motivational quote once a day per email.

## User Acceptance Test 1: Register for service and receive email once a day, same as register

1. Start program in CMD-Line by running "gui_motivational_quotes.py" in program-production folder. (Ensure MongoDB is running and listening on port 27017)
2. See new window opening on screen. New window has 1 field to enter email, and 1 button to "Log In"
3. Enter your email address into the only open textbox.
4. Press "Log In" button
5. New entrie box appears with title "Enter your username" (This happens only for new user)
6. Enter your username. Followed by pressing the "Enter" button
7. The window reloads. You are now succesfully registered and signed up for the service.
8. You can now add or delete your keywords. Or change your preffered email receiving time. You can also unsubscribe and log out. See other User acceptance tests for exact functionality.
9. Now you also need to start the backend driver that actually sends the email. run python driver_backend_sendEmails.py
10. Ensure local outlook is installed and you are logged in with dummy account. (If logged in with personal account it will be used to send emails to each user that you sign up on your machine.)
11. You will see "run me, and I will send emails to all users that are in the db, I check for new users twice a day"
12. Keep this program up and running and you will see emails being send from local outlook.
